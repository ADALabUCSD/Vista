Instructions
============
1. To create the structured data file and download the images first download the original Amazon product metadata files
   from: http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/links.html
2. The raw metadata files in json format contains single quotes which cause failures in python parsing. The single quotes can be changed to double quotes from bash shell as follows:
        sed "s/'/\"/g" input_file.json > output_file.json
3. Place the modified json files in the same directory as the generate_data.py script and modify the list of raw files in line 14 of the generate_data.py file to reflect the downloaded files.
4. Additionally change the number of records to be generated by editing line 18 in generate_data.py script file.
5. Create an empty directory named 'images' in the same directory as the script file and run the script file
   (python generate_data.py).
6. After completing the amazon.csv file will contain all the structured data in the format of <ID, X_str, y> and the images directory will contain all the images (resized to 227*227 resolution).
